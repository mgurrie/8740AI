# Calculator

# Prompt
Help me create python files and a program that is a calculator that calulates addition, subtraction, multipication, and division with any number of inputs. I want a ui as well that is high contrast color. I want a seperate file that contains user tests. I want strong documentation explaining how to use it.

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with an arbitrary number of inputs.
THIS IS COMPLETLY WRITTEN BY AI IN AMAZON Q FOR VS CODE

## Usage

1. Run the `ui.py` file to start the calculator user interface.
2. Click the number buttons to enter the operands.
3. Click the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to specify the operation.
4. Click the "=" button to perform the calculation.
5. The result will be displayed in the input field.

## Testing

To run the tests for the calculator functions, execute the `test_calculator.py` file.

This will run the test cases defined in the `TestCalculator` class and display the results.

## Files

- `calculator.py`: Contains the core logic for performing arithmetic operations.
- `ui.py`: Contains the user interface for the calculator.
- `test_calculator.py`: Contains tests for the calculator functions.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (built-in Python module for GUI)
