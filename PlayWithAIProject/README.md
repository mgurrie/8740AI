Explanation of Key Components:

HTML (index.html):
This file contains the structure of the application with input fields and buttons to add and delete tasks.
The task list will be dynamically populated inside the <ul> element.

CSS (styles.css):
Provides the styles for the application to make it user-friendly and responsive.
Buttons, input fields, and tasks have specific styles to ensure clear distinction and usability.

JavaScript (app.js):
Handles task addition and deletion.
Tasks are stored in the browser's LocalStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
The application dynamically generates list items for each task, with a "Delete" button attached to each task.
Tasks are saved as a list in LocalStorage, and when the page reloads, tasks are retrieved and displayed again.


Improvements and Extensions:
Edit Task: You can add functionality to edit a task after it's been added.
Task Completion: Add a checkbox to mark tasks as completed.
Filters: Implement filters to show active, completed, or all tasks.
Backend: If needed in the future, the project can be extended to have a backend (using Node.js or any other server-side technology) to store tasks in a database.
